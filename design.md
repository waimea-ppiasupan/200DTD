Project Author: **Phanumat Piasupan**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Home cooking enthusiasts like my dad are always on the lookout for recipes. They enjoy searching them up online. However it is not easy to keep track of all the cooking recipes since they often happens to not be in a single website. A system that helped Home cooking enthusiasts to store cooking recipes websites would be useful.

### End-User Requirements

Home cooking enthusiasts like my dad can be old folks and may not be that familiar with using internet . This means that any system must use clear and simple language, and be suitable for people of his age. It should be accessible in terms of colours and fonts used. The level of IT expertise of the user like my dad should be simple to use. This means that the system must be very intuitive to use, So the system should be nicely designed, maybe with food theme would be good.

### Proposed Solution

Features that the website would need to have for it to be successful would be:

- adding recipes.
- removing recipes.
- saving recipes.
- adjusting the size of recipes.
- viewing recipes.
- adding notes to recipes.
- cancelling adding recipes.
- cancelling removing recipes.
- adding titles to recipes.

And so a solution would be to create an iframe website that allows the user to store cooking recipes website and being able to add more or remove it and also be able to adjust the iframe inlcuding the size, the title and some breif note of what the iframe is about as well as having access to the website as a whole.

## Relevant Implications

### 1. Usability

The usability of a system is about how easy it is for home cooking enthusiasts like my dad to use the website. This can be measured by:

- Making the system status clear, the Home Cooking UI simple, clean and easy enough language to read and follow through, so the website should be kept minimalistic so my dad can easily find and follow his favourite recipes without getting confused.

- The Home Cooking UI needs to be consistent, meaning a familiar layout, like for example, same design for each recipe page, so my dad will have an easier time following through the website since things are kept consistent.

- How the Home Cooking UI works should be intuitive to the user, meaning when my dad is using the functionality of the website, like searching for recipes or bookmarking favourites, it should feel natural to him, like he's using a familiar kitchen tool.

### 2. Functionality

The functionality of a system is about what it can do for home cooking enthusiasts like my dad. This can be measured by:

- The website can display a list of recipes, allowing my dad to browse through his collection.

- The website can provide a search function, allowing my dad to find specific iframe by name.

- The website can allow my dad to bookmark his favourite recipes, making it easy for him to access them later.


### 3.Aesthetics

The aesthetics of a system is about how it looks and feels for home cooking enthusiasts like my dad. This can be measured by:

- The website having a clean and simple design, making it easy for my dad to focus on the recipes.

- The website using a consistent layout, so my dad can easily find what he's looking for.

- The website having a visually appealing colour, making it enjoyable for my dad to use.




### 4.End-Users

How easy it is for my dad to use the website, even if he's not tech-skilled.

- How well the website works on different devices, such as his phone or tablet, so he can use it wherever he wants.

- How clear and simple the instructions are, so my dad can easily find and follow his favourite recipes.

- How much control my dad has over the website's functionality, so he can customize his experience.

- How well the website protects my dad's information, so he can feel safe using it.




### 5.Accessibility

The accessibility of a system is about how easy it is for people with disabilities to use, including my dad. This can be measured by:

- How well the website works with screen readers, so my dad can use it even if he has trouble seeing.

- How easy it is for my dad to navigate the website using only his keyboard, in case he has trouble using a mouse.

- How clear and simple the language is, so my dad can understand it even if he has trouble reading.

- How consistent the website's layout is, so my dad can easily find what he's looking for.

- How well the website provides alternative text for images, so my dad can understand the content even if he can't see the images.
