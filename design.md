# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Cooking Website Storement**

Project Author: **Phanumat Piasupan**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------
//nD//
## System Requirements
Some features that the website would need for it to be successful would be for the user to be able to add the cooking recipes in, and being able to remove it, they also need to be able to edit the details of website and have a link so that they can click to access the website just in case they needed to. 

### Identified Need or Problem
Home cooking enthusiasts like my dad are always on the lookout for recipes. They enjoy searching them up online. However it is not easy to keep track of all the cooking recipes since they often happens to not be in a single website. A system that helped Home cooking enthusiasts to store cooking recipes websites would be useful.
### End-User Requirements
Home cooking enthusiasts like my dad can be old folks and may not be that familiar with using internet . This means that any system must use clear and simple language, and be suitable for people of his age. It should be accessible in terms of colours and fonts used. The level of IT expertise of the user like my dad should be simple to use. This means that the system must be very intuitive to use, So the system should be nicely designed, maybe with food theme would be good.

### Proposed Solution

A solution would be to create an iframe website that allows the user to store cooking recipes website and being able to add more or remove it and also be able to adjust the size of the iframes website as well as having access to the website as a whole.

## Relevant Implications
### IMPLICATION NAME HERE


1. Usability
The usability of a system is about  how simple it is for the home cooking enthusiasts such as my dad to use the website.
This can be measured by including:

- making the system status clear, the Ui simple, clean and easy enough language to read and follow through, this means that the website should be kept at a minimalistic so that My dad can easily use the website without getting confused.

- The Ui needs to be consistent, meaning a familiar layout as an example, so in that way my dad can have an easier time follow through the website since things are kept consistent, my dad will have an easier time using the website, due to the consistency in each page

- How the Ui works should be intuitive to the user, meaning when my dad are using the functionality of the website, it should feels natural to him.

2.Functionality
The functionality of a system relates to how well it works for the end-user such as a home cooking enthusiast like my dad, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.
functionality can be measured by:

- Does it do everything it is supposed to, and meets its purpose, e.g. can my dad add and delete the websites as he wanted to?, can he adjust the size of the iframe and can he have access to it?

- Is it bug-free and doesn't crash?

- Does is work as expected from my dad's point-of-view?, is it simple enough for him to follow through?

And When I create a digital technologies outcome, I should try to:

- Fully satisfy my dad's needs for the website being able to store websites in an iframe form.

- Fully meet the user's requirements, being able to store, access and delete the iframe.

- Make sure that it copes with all inputs (normal, boundary and abnormal)

3.Aesthetics
The aesthetic implications of a website relate to how it looks in terms of design.
Usability can be measured by:

- Does the design appeal to my dad?, e.g. does it look good, relate to the theme and easy design for my dad to understand its purposes?

- Does the design follow conventions?

- Has good use been made of colour, font, positioning, etc.?

When I create a digital technologies outcome, I should try to:

- Create an overall design that appeals to the end-users like my dad.

- Create an overall design that is suitable for the outcome's purpose

- Use colours that work effectively together to create a pleasing effect

- Use fonts that work well with the design and convey the appropriate 'feel'

- Position elements of the design in a way that is balanced

- Group / seperate elements to focus attention and/or link related items

4.End-Users
The end-user implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) are connected to the specific needs of the end-user(s).
Usability can be measured by:

- Are the end-users' specific needs considered (age, education level, interests, etc)?

- Does it appeal to the correct demographic?

- Does is work on the type(s) of device the end-users are likely to use?

When I create a digital technologies outcome, I should try to...

- Know as much as possible about your end-user(s) in terms of age, gender, interests, etc.

- Use language and other content appropriate to your end-user(s)

- Make regular use of end-user feedback to guide your design and implementation

- Ensure it works on a range of devices, especially those likely to be used by the end-user(s)





### IMPLICATION NAME HERE
5.Accessibility
The accessibility implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) involve ensuring it is available to, and can be used by, all end-users, regardless of their abilities.

Usability can be measured by:

- Can all end-users access the content and functionality, include those with impaired vision, colour-blindness, dyslexia, etc.?

- Is the outcome accessible on a range of devices?

When I create a digital technologies outcome, I should try to...

-Select colour / tone combinations to give good levels of contrast to aid in accessing text / icons / graphics

-Select fonts / text sizes to make sure text is easily readable on all screen sizes

-Provide 'alt' text for all images (e.g. for screen-reader software to read aloud)

-Provide appropriate structure (e.g. via the correct mark-up) to aid in understanding the content

-Make UI components accessible in terms of size / target area, etc.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
