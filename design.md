Project Name: **Cooking Website Storement**

Project Author: **Phanumat Piasupan**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Home cooking enthusiasts like my dad are always on the lookout for recipes. They enjoy searching them up online. However it is not easy to keep track of all the cooking recipes since they often happens to not be in a single website. A system that helped Home cooking enthusiasts to store cooking recipes websites would be useful.

### End-User Requirements

Home cooking enthusiasts like my dad can be old folks and may not be that familiar with using internet . This means that any system must use clear and simple language, and be suitable for people of his age. It should be accessible in terms of colours and fonts used. The level of IT expertise of the user like my dad should be simple to use. This means that the system must be very intuitive to use, So the system should be nicely designed, maybe with food theme would be good.

### Proposed Solution

Features that the website would need to have for it to be successful would be:

- adding recipes.
- removing recipes.
- saving recipes.
- adjusting the size of recipes.
- viewing recipes.
- adding notes to recipes.
- cancelling adding recipes.
- cancelling removing recipes.
- adding titles to recipes.

And so a solution would be to create an iframe website that allows the user to store cooking recipes website and being able to add more or remove it and also be able to adjust the iframe inlcuding the size, the title and some breif note of what the iframe is about as well as having access to the website as a whole.

## Relevant Implications

### 1. Usability

The usability of a system is about how easy it is for home cooking enthusiasts like my dad to use the website. This can be measured through Nielson's heuristics by:

- Visibility of System Status, Match Between System and the Real World, and Consistency and Standards:
Making the system status clear, the Home Cooking UI simple, clean and easy enough language to read and follow through, so the website should be kept minimalistic so my dad can easily find and follow his favourite recipes without getting confused.

- Aesthetic and minimalist design, and Consistency and standards:
The Home Cooking UI needs to be consistent, meaning a familiar layout, like for example, same design for each recipe page, so my dad will have an easier time following through the website since things are kept consistent.

- Recognition rather than recall:
How the Home Cooking UI works should be intuitive to the user, meaning when my dad is using the functionality of the website, like searching for recipes or bookmarking favourites, it should feel natural to him, like he's using a familiar kitchen tool.

With these in mind, I need to make sure that I design a website that:

- Provides clear system status updates to my dad
- Uses familiar language and design elements to make the website intuitive
- Maintains a consistent and minimalistic design throughout
- Ensures that functionality is intuitive and feels natural to use

By doing so, I can create a website that is user-friendly and easy for my dad to navigate, making it an enjoyable experience for him to find and follow his favorite recipes. 

### 2. Functionality

The functionality of a system is about what it can do for home cooking enthusiasts like my dad. This can be measured through Nielson's heuristics by:

-  Recognition Rather Than Recall:
The website can display a list of recipes, allowing my dad to browse through his collection.

- Flexibility and efficiency of use:
The website can provide a search function, allowing my dad to find specific iframe by name.
The website can allow my dad to bookmark his favourite recipes, making it easy for him to access them later.

With these in mind, I need to make sure that I design a website that:

- Provides features that support recognition over recall, such as displaying lists of recipes for easy browsing
- Offers flexible and efficient functionality, like search and bookmarking, to help my dad quickly find and access his favorite recipes
- Streamlines the user experience to make it easy for my dad to use the website and accomplish his goals"

By doing so, I can create a website that is both functional and user-friendly, making it an enjoyable experience for my dad to find and use his favorite recipes.


### 3.Aesthetics

The aesthetics of a system is about how it looks and feels for home cooking enthusiasts like my dad. This can be measured through Nielson's heuristics by:

- Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:
The website having a clean and simple design, making it easy for my dad to focus on the recipes, which also helps to maintain a consistency design and make the website easier to use.

- Consistency and standards:
The website using a consistent layout, so my dad can easily find what he's looking for.

- Match between system and the real world:
The website having a visually appealing colour, making it enjoyable for my dad to use and also having colours that has a similar layout to the real life kitchen making it more intuitive for my dad to use the website

With these in mind, I need to make sure that I design a website that:

- Has a clean and simple design that makes it easy for my dad to focus on the recipes and maintain a consistent design language
- Uses a consistent layout throughout, so my dad can easily find what he's looking for
- Uses visually appealing colors that are intuitive and familiar, making it enjoyable and easy for my dad to use the website, just like he would in a real-life kitchen

By doing so, I can create a website that is aesthetically pleasing, intuitive, and easy to use for my dad, making his experience with the website enjoyable and effective.




### 4.End-Users

How easy it is for my dad to use the website, even if he's not tech-skilled. which can be measured through Neilsen's heuristic by:

- Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:
How well the website works on different devices, such as his phone or tablet, so he can use it wherever he wants.

-User control and freedom:
 How much control my dad has over the website's functionality, so he can customize his experience.

- Error Prevention:
 How well the website protects my dad's information, so he can feel safe using it.

With these in mind, I need to make sure I design a website that:

- Works seamlessly across different devices, allowing my dad to access it anywhere, anytime
- Provides features that give my dad control over his experience, so he can customize it to his needs
- Prioritizes error prevention, protecting my dad's information and making him feel safe and secure while using the website

By doing so, I can create a website that is accessible, user-friendly, and trustworthy for my dad, even if he's not tech-savvy.



### 5.Accessibility

The accessibility of a system is about how easy it is for people with disabilities to use, including my dad. This can be measured through neilsen's heuristics by:

- Consistency and Standards:
How well the website works with screen readers, so my dad can use it even if he has trouble seeing.

- Flexibility and efficiency of use, and Aesthetic and minimalist design:
How easy it is for my dad to navigate the website using only his keyboard, in case he has trouble using a mouse.

-  Match Between System and the Real World:
 How clear and simple the language is, so my dad can understand it even if he has trouble reading.

- Consistency and standards:
How consistent the website's layout is, so my dad can easily find what he's looking for.

- Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:
How well the website provides alternative text for images, so my dad can understand the content even if he can't see the images.
With these in mind, I need to make sure that I design a website that:

- Works seamlessly with screen readers to assist visually impaired users
- Allows easy keyboard navigation for users with mobility impairments
- Uses clear and simple language for users with reading difficulties
- Maintains a consistent layout for easy navigation
- Provides alternative text for images to ensure all content is accessible

By doing so, I can create a website that is accessible and user-friendly for my dad and other users with disabilities
